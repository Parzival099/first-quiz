## System Security

As Head of Engineering of our innovative technology startup Uber for Solar Panels. I would take into account the OWASP Top 10 and take into account all the recommendations and start with the most serious degree of vulnerability, for example:

Injection attacks: we must protect ourselves. We have to ensure user inputs are validated correctly and use parameterized queries when interacting with the MySQL database.

Authentication and authorization: Secure authentication mechanisms must be implemented for both your mobile and web applications. Ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive customer information and functions.

Sensitive data exposure: Protect customer information, including passwords and personal data, by encrypting it both in transit and at rest. Implement data masking or anonymization when appropriate to limit access to confidential details. In addition, major security failures often involve theft of information in the connection or routes where the data passes. We must encrypt and protect ourselves against tunneling or theft attacks. of information in the connection with the server.

Security misconfigurations: Kubernetes configurations, AWS configuration, and application code should be periodically reviewed to identify and resolve any misconfigurations and try to do preventive security.

Broken access control: I would also focus on making proper access control for different user roles. We must ensure that customer service employees can only access information and perform actions authorized for their functions, in addition to further restricting access to the sales employee.

Using components with known vulnerabilities: I would do is quickly update and patch all the components, libraries and dependencies used in your applications, in addition to starting to organize it on a periodic and fairly short basis.

Insufficient logging and monitoring: Comprehensive logging and monitoring should be established to detect and respond to security incidents promptly. An intrusion detection system must be developed.

Afterwards, I would focus on preventive solutions that will help us predict where the damage or vulnerabilities in the security systems are heading and I would try to anticipate them, to be able to protect our startup and our clients in a better and much faster way.
